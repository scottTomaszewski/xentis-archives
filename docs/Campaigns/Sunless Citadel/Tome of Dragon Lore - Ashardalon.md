# Tome of Dragon Lore - Ashardalon

Found in the "Dragon Library" within the Sunless Citadel.

## Abstract

After suffering a mortal wound, Ashardalon attempted to extend his life by binding a balor called Ammet to his chest in order to function as a second heart. However, his injuries were too extensive for the balor's power to keep Ashardalon alive. He then moved to a domain in the Astral Plane known as the Bastion of Unborn Souls and established his lair there. He was kept alive thanks to the timeless nature of the Astral Plane and the unusual flow of energy that permeated the Bastion

Although Ashardalon has no known presence on Toril, the tome tells tales of his fortress on another world...
