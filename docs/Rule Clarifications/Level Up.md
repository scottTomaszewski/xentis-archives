# Level Up

## Leveling Up Without a Long Rest

When acquiring enough experience or hitting a milestone that would satisfy the conditions for leveling up, player characters may not be in a place to take a Long Rest (usually because the characters aren't tired yet.)  In these cases, characters may level up without a Long Rest.

- No "recovery" or "swapping" that requires a Short Rest or Long Rest
	- Healing with hit dice, recovery of class features (ex: Channel Divinity), recovery of Warlock Pact Slots, etc
	- Any abilities that allow a character to swap out features, such as prepared spells
- Swapping of features on level up is allowed
	- Any feature that allows swapping on a level-up is permitted
	- Example: `Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the [class] spells you know and replace it with another spell from the [class] spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.`
- New features are gained
	- Any new feature granted as part of the level up are immediately gained.
- Spell Slots are gained
	- New Spell Slots are gained
	- Existing Spell Slots remain as they were (they don't recover)
