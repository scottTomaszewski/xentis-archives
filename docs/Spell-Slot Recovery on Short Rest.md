# Spell-Slot Recovery on Short Rest

When taking a short rest, spellcasters are able to recover spell slots in exchange for hit dice.  Spellcasters are divided into the following categories:

**Full Casters** - Sorcerer, wizard, druid, bard, cleric, (warlock)

**Half-Casters** - Paladin, Ranger, Artificer

**Special** - Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster, etc
