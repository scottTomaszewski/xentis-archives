# Resurrection

When a creature is resurrected, the caster ("resurrecter") makes a Spellcasting Ability Check against the target's `Death DC`.  The `Death DC` starts at `13` and increment by `3` for each death experienced.

***Rapid Resurrection:*** For spells that are 1 Action, the resurrecter rolls against the `Death DC` alone.  Failing the Check will increase the target's `Death DC` by 1 and _Rapid Resurrection_ attempts will automatically fail until the target is resurrected via a _Resurrection Ritual_ or _Advanced Resurrection_.

***Resurrection Ritual:*** For spells that are longer than 1 Action, other PCs can assist in a _Resurrection Ritual_ by rolling a relevant Skill Check they are proficient in against the target's original `Death DC`.  On a pass, the target's `Death DC` is reduced by 1.  No effect on a fail. If the ritual fails, the soul is lost and can only be brought back by _Advanced Resurrection_.

***Advanced Resurrection:*** The _True Resurrection_ and _Wish_ spells automatically succeed and do not require rolls against the `Death DC`.
